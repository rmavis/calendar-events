From calendar:
DESCRIPTION
     The calendar utility checks the current directory or the directory specified by the
     CALENDAR_DIR environment variable for a file named calendar and displays lines that be‐
     gin with either today's date or tomorrow's.  On Fridays, events on Friday through Mon‐
     day are displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -A num  Print lines from today and next num days (forward, future).  Defaults to one.
             (same as -l)
     -B num  Print lines from today and previous num days (backward, past).
     -f calendarfile
             Use calendarfile as the default calendar file. If this file is not accessible,
             the system-wide default is used.

     -t [[[cc]yy]mm]dd
             Act like the specified value is “today” instead of using the current date.  If
             yy is specified, but cc is not, a value for yy between 69 and 99 results in a
             cc value of 19.  Otherwise, a cc value of 20 is used.
